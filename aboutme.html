            <p>
               Bonjour tout le monde! This is my personal website :) You're reading this on the 
               'about me' page, so I guess I should tell you a little bit about me. I have 
               trouble introducing or describing myself since I dislike talking about myself. 
               Since you've come and are curious about me, I hope you'll find me interesting 
               towards the end of this page.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              I am a pessimist, which is one of the characteristics I dislike about myself. I'm 
              now working on loving myself. There are numerous things I enjoy doing, seeing, 
              and experiencing. I enjoy reading, writing stories, designing, drawing, and 
              painting, as well as thinking and dreaming. I enjoy seeing the moonlight and 
              stars at night, and I enjoy smelling the sea breeze. I enjoy staring at the 
              clouds in the sky with my thoughts blank. The seasons I prefer are spring, autumn,
               and winter. Summer is off my agenda because I want to make a snowman under the 
               snow in winter. I prefer to be alone, but I also prefer to be surrounded by people. I enjoy spicy foods. 
               I love to read good books and binge-watching movies. I like people, but not everyone :D
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              I also wanted to publish a story that would impart everyone a valuable lesson. Through my 
              stories, I hope to connect with millions of people. Aside from the Information Technology 
              program I'm currently enrolled in, I've always desired to be a great psychologist. I want 
              to reassure and show to people that they are not alone. I also want to be a graphic designer;
              I want to express and share my color palettes with anyone who is missing something in their
              lives.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              So that's a quick rundown of who I am. I suppose I spent my entire life swimming in the 
              shape of an artist. By the way, I'm a Pisces, so that explains a lot.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              Life is short so spend it with a pisces :)
