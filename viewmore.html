          If I hadn't known better, I'd assume you're interested in me because you're reading 
          this right now. Ooops! DON'T FROWN, I COULD SEE THROUGH YOU! Smile :)) 
          A genuine smile is exactly what the world needs right now.

          You've come to this page to read more about life lessons. I recently finished Mark Manson's 
          book THE SUBTLE ART OF NOT GIVING A FUCK. Because it's the only book I'm reading right now,
          it's my current favorite. The book taught me valuable life lessons.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here are my top three favorite Michael Renney lessons that I'd like to share with you:
        </p>
        <span class="wan">
          1.) And that your fear of failure is your biggest enemy. <br>
          <span class="wann">
          "We can be truly successful only at something we're willing to fail at. If we're
          unwilling to fail, then we're unwilling to succeed."
         </span>
        </span>

        <span class="wan">
          2.) Not every "problem" has to be a negative thing. <br>
          <span class="wann">
          "Don't hope for a life without problems. There's no such thing. Instead,
          hope for a life full of good problems."
         </span>
        </span>

        <span class="wan">
          3.) Hard times area a necessary part of life. <br>
          <span class="wann">
          "Who you are is defined by what you're willing to struggle for."
         </span>
        </span>
          
        <p>
          We are all strong enough to tackle challenges, but we are also vulnerable.
          We must also be gentle to ourselves.
        </p>
        <p class="quote">
          "Most days we have to remind ourselves to keep it gentle --- no matter how slow we go 
          or no matter the amount of progress we make. It matters when we make a difference,
          but it matters most if we take good care of ourselves in all aspects.
          See how things unfold spontaneously --- walk, but not in haste, keep it gentle." 
        <br>
